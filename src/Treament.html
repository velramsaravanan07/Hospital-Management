<h2>Refractive Surgery</h2>
<p>Refractive surgery is a surgical procedure performed to correct the refractive error 
(spectacle power) of the eye. It is usually done to get rid of or reduce dependence
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

 on glasses and contact lens . It can be performed in a patient with stable refraction
  (glass power) after the age of 18 – 21 years. Complete medical history along with
   detailed eye examination is mandatory in all candidates, special Investigations 
    corneal topography (Pentacam, Orbscan), Anterior segment Optical Coherence Tomography
     (ASOCT) are performed to evaluate the shape, thickness and curvature of the cornea 
     and other dimensions of the eye. </span></p>

<h2>Dry Eye Surgery</h2>
<p>On a summer day, on an average, people might be spending around 
14 to 16 hours per day in an air-conditioned room, at work or at
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 

 home to escape the heat outside and some of them might feel  dryness,
  irritation, stickiness, itching, burning and watering from the eyes
 They may be developing  a problem which is  termed as the “Dry eye”, ‘Dry Eye Syndrome’ medically.
 Commonest cause of dry eyes are the air conditioners. The artificial air and temperature change
  caused by the air conditioners can cause changes and effect  the largest organ of
   the body- the skin to the immune system, to the most delicate organ the eyes.</span></p>

<h2>Lasik Surgery</h2>
<P> Laser eye treatment as an option for eye power correction has been
     in vogue for over two decades now. The first laser vision
<span id="dots">...</span><span id id="more"> 
 correction was performed in Germany in the late 80s, and since then,
  there’ve been major advancements that have improved the quality of
   the surgery in terms of safety and precision. While laser eye treatment is primarily used for
     correcting refractive errors, laser technology has been put to good use
      in cataract and retinal treatments as well.Laser vision correction
       is by far the best option to eliminate the dependency on glasses and contact lenses. The shape of your
       cornea attributes to your eye power.</span></P>

<h2>Glued IOL</h2>
<p>A Glued intraocular lens IOL is a technique, a glued IOL
 procedure is initially performed, followed by an IOL
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
Scaffold procedure. This technique is specially effective
 in cases with deficient posterior capsule support and
sulus or iris support. This technique is also applicable for 
managing a traumatic subluxated lens and Soemmering ring.</span></p>

<h2>PDEK</h2>
<p>Pre Descemet's Endothelial Keratoplasty is a partial thickness 
corneal transplant. The diseased endothelial cells are removed
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
rom the patient's eye and selectively replaced with a new layer
 of endothelial cells which are taken from the donated eye. The
 endothelial cells are the healthy cells lining the back of the
cornea which pump fluid from the cornea to prevent cornea swelling.</span></p>

    <h2>Pinhole Pupilloplasty</h2>
    <p>
Corneal astigmatism may be regular or irregular
 variant. With regular variant, good visual acuity can be attained
 <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
  either by correction with glasses or surgically by performing 
  astigmatic keratotomy. The irregular variant is difficult to
   correct with spectacles due to induced aberrations. Therefore, 
   for such cases, other interventions like placing corneal inlays and
    pinhole intraocular lenses (IOLs) came into existence.</span></p>

<h2>Corneal Transplant</h2>
<p>A corneal transplant involves surgically removing the patient’s diseased cornea and replacing it 
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 

    with a donated corneal tissue. This improves the vision in conditions where blurring is due 
    a corneal pathology generally after trauma, after infection and congenital or genetic corneal
     disorders. After eye donation cornea is removed from the donor eye ball and used during cornea transplantation

    <h2>Pnenmatic Retinopexy(PX)</h2>
<p>Pneumatic Retinopexy (PR) is one of the treatment options available
     for retinal detachment (RD). In this procedure, the
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
surgeon injects a long-acting expandable gas bubble to seal the
       retinal break. The advantage of this procedure is that it is a very
        quick, minimally invasive procedure unlike other surgical treatment 
        modalities for RD.  But the success rate of the procedure is relatively
         less (60-70%). If the RD is not settling, extensive surgery might be required.

    <h2>Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)</h2>

<p>Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a type of refractive
 laser surgery that reshapes the cornea to correct myopia
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 

 (short-sightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness and 
 astigmatism (unevenly curved cornea). It helps in decreasing 
 or eliminating the dependency on glasses or contact lenses. 
 The goal of refractive surgery is to allow less dependency
  on glasses and contact lenses rather than achieve the complete absence of refractive error.)</span></p>

       <h2>Laser Cataract Surgery</h2> 
        <p>
            Cataract is the opacification of natural clear lens
            . As a part of treatment, cataract has to be removed 
            <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
            and replaced with an artificial intraocular lens. Cataract surgery
             is a process of removal of cloudy lens. Change is the only constant 
             thing in this world. As the science advances, method for removal 
             cataract is getting better and better. Veteran ophthalmologist had
              seen transformation from Intracapsular cataract surgery to extracapsular cataract surgery.</span></p>

        <h2>Black Fungus Diagnosis</h2>

        Black fungus diagnosis is challenging because the symptoms
         are common to several other conditions. It’s diagnosis 
         <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

         hence involves a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical
          evaluation, and a variety of specialised tests. A diagnosis 
          is made by identifying the mold in the affected tissue by fungal
           culture. It is important to diagnose this condition as early as possible for a better prognosis.</span>

    <h2>Smile Eye Surgery</h2>
<p>The clarity of your vision depends on the cornea and lens
 working together to focus a clear image onto the retina.
 <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

  This process involves the refraction or bending of 
  light rays to create a sharp image on the retina. However,
   when the cornea’s shape is altered, the image on the retina
    becomes unfocused, resulting in blurry vision. SMILE surgery, a 
    cutting-edge procedure, targets these refractive errors by 
    precisely reshaping the cornea. With the help of femtosecond laser,
     this reshaping process helps to correct the refractive error and improve vision clarity.
